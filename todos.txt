Need to do
----------

- figure out how to deal with __init__ signature for subclasses
- figure out how to deal with __init__ documentation for subclasses
- figure out how to allow GLM classes to have arguments in init
Probable solution: make the CV objects have a base argument that containts the base estimator.

- multinomial
- huber
- Poisson
- Gamma
- max pen val for Tikhonov
- total variation CV and max pen val
- extend LLA algorithm to group lasso and nuclear norm

- testing testing testing
- documentation documentation documentation
- speed comparison of opt module
- compare fits to sklearn baseline



Eventualy
---------
- sample weights
- cox
- quantile regression (this will require a different default solver -- perhaps cvxpy?)
- constraints: positive, simplex
- bulid coordinate descent framework (e.g. based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1386)
- for cv_scorer figure out how to have custom fit_metrics (e.g. for n_nonzero) instead of the ugly train/test

- add better print progress for cv_run_path in parallel e.g. see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/2beed55847ee70d363bdbfe14ee4401438fba057/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py#L454
